# kanban

Very simple terminal kanban board.
All board editing besides moving cards around happens in `$EDITOR`.

```
arrows         move around between cards/columns
shift-arrows   change card order/column
e              edit the .toml file backing the board
ctrl-s         save
enter          if "link" is defined for the current card, open it
q              quit
```
